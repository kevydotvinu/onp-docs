# Additional Network Interfaces

To add an additional network interface to the OpenShift cluster nodes, the Cockpit console access is required. For this purpose, the ONP has two interfaces.

* onp1
* onp2

Both the interface can be added directly from the virtual machine console. Here are the steps to achieve that.

By default, the DHCP server for the additional interface will be turned off. To start and manage the service, the below command will be useful.

#### Check the service

```
onp services
```

#### Start the service

```
sudo systemctl start onp1-dhcp
```

#### Check the logs

```
journalctl -f -u dhcp
```
