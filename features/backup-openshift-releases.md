# Backup OpenShift Releases

The OpenShift cluster can be stored and restored to reduce the installation time. The restoration of the cluster hardly takes seven minutes to initialize the cluster.

## How it works

To store the cluster, onp takes the below actions.

* Gracefully shuts down the cluster.
* Copy the virtual machine disk to another location.
* Copy the `kubeconfig` and `kubeadmin-password` files to another location.

The restoration takes the reverse and wait for the cluster to initialize properly.
