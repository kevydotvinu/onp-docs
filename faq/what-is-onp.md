# What is ONP?

The OpenShift Network Playground is a lab environment with both a web-based and cli-based interface built for advanced OpenShift users to provide the ease of quickly building and testing different OpenShift network scenarios. The key benefits are:

* OpenShift IPI cluster
* Additional network interfaces
* IPv6 OpenShift cluster
* OpenShift cluster node access without network
